n8n Agent: Automated Gmail Workflow Integration
Welcome! This project demonstrates how to use n8n agents to automate workflows involving HTTP requests, email actions (Gmail), parsing responses in JSON, and managing agent memory for advanced automation scenarios.

Features
Perform outbound HTTP(S) requests from n8n to interact with external APIs/services.

Automate Gmail operations: read, send, and process emails programmatically.

Parse responses using n8n's output parsers (including JSON formats).

Use n8n agent memory for multi-step workflow state management and context retention.

Design workflows to automateâ€”from fetching and parsing forms to sending automated email responses.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
n8n installed

A Google account with Gmail API access enabled

Basic familiarity with n8n workflows and credentials

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n8n-agent-gmail-automation.git
cd n8n-agent-gmail-automation
Set up n8n with your environment:

Install and run n8n:

bash
npm install -g n8n
n8n start
Or, use Docker for portability.

Import Workflows:

Download/export the .json workflow file from this repo.

In the n8n editor UI, click "Import Workflow" and select the file.

Configure Credentials:

Set up Gmail credentials and any API credentials needed for your HTTP nodes.

Usage
Automate incoming form emails: Automatically fetch emails, extract structured data using an output parser, and push results to any HTTP API or backend.

Respond to emails: Automatically send templated or logic-based replies based on parsed content.

Chaining and memory: Keep agent "memory" of prior steps allowing for contextual, multi-stage automations.

Example Workflow Overview
Trigger: Gmail node watches for new emails or form submissions.

Processing: Output parser node extracts data or JSON payload.

HTTP Request: Sends or retrieves additional data from external services/APIs.

Automated Response: Sends formatted reply via Gmail node.

Memory: Uses agent memory/context to keep conversation/workflow consistent across multiple steps.

Customization
Modify or extend workflows for your business logic.

Integrate with additional n8n nodes (Google Sheets, databases, Slack, etc.).

Use IF nodes and agent memory to build more intelligent, dynamic workflows.
